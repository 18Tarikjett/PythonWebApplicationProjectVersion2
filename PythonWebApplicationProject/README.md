# PythonWebApplicationProject
Web application project in python for coursework 

This is a Python web application which acts as a help desk ticket service. It utilizes django, docker and an assortment of other dependencies which depending on the environment being constructed on will need installation.

Users can register, login and create, read and update tickets they raise for hardware or software issues. 

It is highly recommended that you create a virtual environment for this project before activating or installing any dependencies, rather than doing system wide installations. 

Your environment will need docker compose if you do not have it already, the installation guide for docker compose can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
